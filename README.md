# Create-a-Strong-Password-and-Evaluate-Its-Strength.
# Strong Password Assessment Repository

This repository is a ready-to-use GitHub project for **creating, testing, and reporting on password strength**. It contains step-by-step instructions, an editable `Report.md` template (with screenshot placeholders), a `README.md` to explain the repo and how to reproduce the tests, and a small utility script to generate passphrases locally.

> ⚠️ **Security note:** Never use any password in this repo for real accounts. The examples are for demonstration only. When you test passwords against public services, avoid submitting passwords you actually use — prefer generated test values or passphrases you will never reuse.

# Strong Password Assessment

This project demonstrates how to **create strong passwords**, evaluate them using common online tools, and produce a clean, reproducible report suitable for publishing in a GitHub repository.

## Goals
- Explain what makes a password strong.
- Show step-by-step how to test passwords using online tools (PasswordMeter, zxcvbn demo, HaveIBeenPwned Pwned Passwords).
- Produce `Report.md` with test results and screenshot placeholders so the repository looks polished.

## Quick start
1. Clone this repo.
2. (Optional) Generate sample passphrases with `python generate_password.py`.
3. For each password you want to test:
   - Evaluate at https://passwordmeter.com/ and save a screenshot to `screenshots/`.
   - Try the zxcvbn demo and save a screenshot to `screenshots/`.
   - Check the Have I Been Pwned (Pwned Passwords) range API using the k-anonymity method (instructions in `Report.md` and `docs/methodology.md`).
4. Fill the `Report.md` table with scores and paste screenshots.

## Tips & best practices
- Prefer **long passphrases** (12+ characters; 16+ recommended for high value accounts).
- Use **password managers** to create and store unique passwords for each account.
- **Never reuse** passwords across sites.
- Check passwords against breached lists (Pwned Passwords) rather than relying only on entropy meters.

## Files explained
- `Report.md` — The test report template with tables, explanation, and screenshot placeholders.
- `generate_password.py` — Simple secure passphrase generator.
- `sample_passwords.txt` — Example passwords (weak→strong) for testing.
- `docs/methodology.md` — Write-up of the testing methodology and references.

## References
- NIST Digital Identity Guidelines recommend guidance and breached-password checking for authentication systems (see `docs/methodology.md`)

# Password Strength Test Report

**Project:** Strong Password Assessment

**Date:** <REPLACE_WITH_DATE>

## Executive Summary
Brief: this report demonstrates how password strength varies across simple rules-based meters and pattern-aware estimators — and why checking breached password lists is critical.

## Methodology
We tested example passwords using three types of checks:
1. **PasswordMeter (passwordmeter.com)** — rules/heuristic-based score (0–100).
2. **zxcvbn (Dropbox demo)** — pattern-aware estimator that returns a 0–4 score and an estimated number of guesses.
3. **Pwned Passwords (Have I Been Pwned)** — checks whether a password has appeared in breaches using a k-anonymity API.

> Screenshots from each step were saved to `screenshots/` (placeholders included below).

## Tested passwords
| ID | Password (example — do NOT use) | Notes |
|---:|---------------------------------|-------|
| W1 | `password123`                    | Weak (common) |
| M1 | `Pa$$w0rd!2021`                  | Medium (composition) |
| S1 | `correcthorsebatterystaple!`     | Strong (passphrase-style) |
| G1 | (generated by `generate_password.py`) | Long passphrase generated locally |

## Results summary
| ID | PasswordMeter (0–100) | zxcvbn score (0–4) | Pwned? (yes/no + count) | Screenshot |
|---:|----------------------:|-------------------:|------------------------:|-----------:|
| W1 | `<placeholder>`       | `<placeholder>`    | `<placeholder>`         | `screenshots/passwordmeter_weak.png` |
| M1 | `<placeholder>`       | `<placeholder>`    | `<placeholder>`         | `screenshots/passwordmeter_medium.png` |
| S1 | `<placeholder>`       | `<placeholder>`    | `<placeholder>`         | `screenshots/passwordmeter_strong.png` |
| G1 | `<placeholder>`       | `<placeholder>`    | `<placeholder>`         | `screenshots/pwned_check_example.png` |

**How to reproduce the Pwned check (k-anonymity):**
1. Compute the SHA-1 of the UTF-8 password (hexadecimal, uppercase).
2. Send only the **first 5 characters** of the SHA-1 to `https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/<PREFIX>`.
3. The service returns a list of trailing SHA-1 suffixes and counts — compare locally to see if the full hash appears.

**Example (bash):**
```bash
# Example: check 'password123' (DON'T use real passwords here)
echo -n "password123" | sha1sum | awk '{print toupper($1)}' | \
  awk '{print substr($0,1,5) " " substr($0,6)}' \
  # send the first 5 chars to the API and grep for the suffix
PREFIX=$(echo -n "password123" | sha1sum | awk '{print toupper($1)}' | cut -c1-5)
SUFFIX=$(echo -n "password123" | sha1sum | awk '{print toupper($1)}' | cut -c6-)
curl -s "https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/$PREFIX" | grep -i "$SUFFIX"
````

If the grep returns a line with a count (e.g. `...:12345`), the password has appeared in breaches.

## Interpretation & recommendations

* A high PasswordMeter score doesn't guarantee the password hasn't been breached — always check breached-lists.
* Pattern-aware estimators (zxcvbn) are better at recognizing weak patterns in complex-looking passwords (e.g., `Summer2020!`) and passphrases are usually preferable.
* Follow NIST-style guidance: **permit long passphrases, check against breach lists, and encourage unique passwords via password managers**.

# Methodology & References

Short notes and references used while preparing the report.

- Use **PasswordMeter** as a rules-based heuristic demonstration tool (not authoritative for breach checks).
- Use **zxcvbn**/pattern-aware estimators to understand how crackers see common patterns.
- Check **Pwned Passwords** to detect whether a password has been exposed in public breaches (k-anonymity range API recommended).

When writing your final report, include screenshots from each tool and explain why each password scored the way it did. Also follow NIST guidance for password policies and breached password screening.
```
**Next steps for you (suggested):**

1. Clone the repo locally.
2. Use `generate_password.py` or create your own passphrases.
3. Test passphrases at the online tools listed, save screenshots into `screenshots/`.
4. Fill `Report.md` with the real values and push to GitHub.

Happy testing — I put the entire repository content into this document so you can copy/paste files directly into your project. If you want, I can now also:

* Generate realistic sample screenshots (mock images) to use as placeholders, or
* Produce a ready-to-upload ZIP with the files pre-filled (but I cannot run external web tools or upload real screenshots for you).
## Conclusion

This project demonstrated how to **create and evaluate passwords** using a combination of tools:

* **PasswordMeter** (rules-based heuristic),
* **zxcvbn** (pattern-aware strength estimator), and
* **Have I Been Pwned Pwned Passwords** (breach database check).

From the results, it is clear that:

1. A password may appear *strong* to a rules-based checker but still be weak if it follows common patterns or has appeared in breaches.
2. Pattern-aware tools like **zxcvbn** provide a more realistic view of how quickly an attacker could guess a password.
3. The most critical step is verifying whether a password has been exposed in data breaches, since even complex-looking passwords can be unsafe once compromised.

**Key takeaways:**

* Long, random **passphrases** (12–16+ characters) offer the best balance of security and usability.
* **Password managers** should be used to generate and store unique passwords for every account.
* **Breach checks** are essential; never rely solely on entropy scores.
* Organizations should follow modern standards (like **NIST Digital Identity Guidelines**) by allowing long passphrases, screening against known-breached passwords, and removing outdated complexity rules.

In summary, a password’s true strength lies not just in its composition, but in **length, unpredictability, and uniqueness** — reinforced by breach awareness. This holistic approach ensures stronger protection against modern password attacks.
